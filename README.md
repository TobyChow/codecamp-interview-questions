# Pracice Interview questions

Goals:

 * Introduce everyone to common interview questions.
 * Pull requests to this repo with your solution.
 * Have fun!

 ## 1. Square Sum

Complete the squareSum method so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example:

```
> squareSum([1, 2, 2]); 
 = 9
```

## 2. High/Low

Given a string of space separated numbers, return the highest and lowest number as a string in form: 

`"High Low"`

Examples:
```
> HighLow("1 2 3 4 5");  
  = "5 1"
> HighLow("1 2 9 4 -3"); 
  = "9 -3"
> HighLow("8 2 2 4 -1"); 
  = "8 -1"
```


 ## 2. Common technical questions
1. How would you verify a prime number?
Ex:
```
> isPrime(137);
  = true
> isPrime(237);
  = false
  ```
2. How do get nth Fibonacci number? What is the run time complexity? Hint: create an array and iterate.
3. How would you remove duplicate members from an array?

 
 ## 3. Soft skills interview questions
 
* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
* What excites or interests you about coding?
* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
* What are some advantages/disadvantages to testing your code?
* What are some of your strengths? What are some of your weaknesses?
